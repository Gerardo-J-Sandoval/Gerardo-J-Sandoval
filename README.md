### About Me
<details>
  <summary>Click to expand </summary>

   I am a Graduate Certificate Student in Aerodynamics at Michigan Tech learning aerodynamics and fluid mechanics. My goal is to pursue an MS and PhD in Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering and to conduct research in fluid mechanics and hypersonics. 
   
   I graduated with a B.S. in Systems Engineering from Texas A&M International University in 2022. Afterwards, I worked at Boeing for 2 years as a Systems Engineer, focusing on aircraft systems integration on the 777X airplane and new commercial airplanes.
