### 1. About Me
I am a Graduate Student in Mechanical & Aerospace Engineering at Michigan Tech University and my main research interests are aerodynamics and hypersonics. I perform independent aerospace R&D on aerospace vehicle design and integration at Interlinked Aerospace. Previously, I worked in the aerospace industry for a few years and graduated with a B.S. in Systems Engineering from Texas A&M International University (TAMIU) in 2022. 

### 2. Book & Publications  
1. Aerospace Vehicle Systems Engineering: A Vehicle-First Approach to Design & Integration (2029 expected)
   - Aerospace Vehicle Systems Engineering (AVSE) is introduced in this book as a new engineering discipline within aerospace engineering - the conceptual spine that unifies the physics, vehicle design, and integration logic of aerospace vehicles. 
   - This book explains how aerospace vehicles are designed, integrated, and matured aross their lifecyle.
   - It examines major classes of aerospace vehicles such as airplanes, UAVs, missiles, and spacecraft, and shows why they differ, how they behave, and what their architectures demand from engineers. 
   - Target Audience: Professional Aerospace Engineers, Engineering Leaders, and Professors & Grad Students in Aerospace Engineering.
